Web-Crawlers
============

Web Crawler research project 

  This research project is the culmination of my education at Pacific Lutheran University.  It will utilize and 
highlight many of the skills I have acquired during the course of my studies. I chose Web Crawlers as the focus of my 
project for a number of reasons. I was working on another project where a Web Crawler is to be a large part of the overall project and found the subject to be fascinating and complex, while the implementation of some Web Crawlers seems to be surprisingly simple and do not require large programs to conduct successful searches. I made the final decision to go with Web Crawlers when I discussed the project with my mentor Dr. George Hauser. 
  I intend to start my project in a general overview, then narrow the focus to a Web Crawler designed to search for very specific searches, such as healthy recipes. To date, the project documentation requirements seem to take so much time I have not really begun the research, except in the barest sense of the word. I have located resources, and briefly perused a few. Stay tuned for futher updates.
